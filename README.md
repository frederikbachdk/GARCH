# The GARCH Option Pricing Model
This is the documentation for the GARCH option pricing model in my bachelor thesis: "The GARCH Option Pricing Model - An Empirical Study Across Shifting Volatility Levels".
The code is written in Ox (OxMetrics), and is based on the S&P500 prices also uploaded here. 
After estimation, the prices are compared to the closing prices of the CBOE.
